title: A Protein-Ligand Interaction-focused 3D Molecular Generative Framework
  for Generalizable Structure-based Drug Design
abstract: Deep generative models have been the subject of immense interest in
  various fields of science. While seeking a molecule that favorably binds to a
  target is a long-established goal of drug design, various generative models
  have emerged to reach the goal. Here, we employ the concept of intermolecular
  interactions between a protein and a ligand in a 3D molecular generative
  model, empowering the generalizable structure-based drug design. Inspired by
  how the practitioners manage to improve the potency of a ligand toward a
  target protein, we devised a strategy where prior knowledge of appropriate
  interactions navigates the ligand generation. We thus propose an
  interaction-focused generative framework, which establishes a local
  interaction condition to capture the surrounding pocket environment. We
  demonstrate that the condition enables precise control of ligand generation,
  justifying its effectiveness in guiding a ligand design inside a binding
  pocket. Through this strategy, the generated ligands could stably bind to the
  target pocket by forming favorable interactions, regardless of pocket type.
  Furthermore, we highlight the broad applicability of our framework by
  leveraging the site-specific interaction condition suitable for designing
  ligands for various purposes.
