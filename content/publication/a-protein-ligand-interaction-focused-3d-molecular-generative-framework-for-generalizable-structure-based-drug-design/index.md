title: 3D Molecular Generative Framework for Interaction-guided Drug Design
abstract: Deep generative modeling has a strong potential to accelerate drug
  design. However, existing generative models often face challenges in
  generalization due to limited data, leading to less innovative designs with
  often unfavorable interactions for unseen target proteins. To address these
  issues, we propose an interaction-aware 3D molecular generative framework that
  enables interaction-guided drug design inside target binding pockets. By
  leveraging universal patterns of protein-ligand interactions as prior
  knowledge, our model can achieve high generalizability with limited
  experimental data. Its performance has been comprehensively assessed by
  analyzing generated ligands for unseen targets in terms of binding pose
  stability, affinity, geometric patterns, diversity, and novelty. Moreover, the
  effective design of potential mutant-selective inhibitors demonstrates the
  applicability of our approach to structure-based drug design.
