title: "DeepBioisostere: Discovering Bioisosteres with Deep Learning for a Fine Control of Multiple Molecular Properties"
abstract: Optimizing molecules to improve their properties is a fundamental challenge in drug design. For a fine-tuning of molecular properties without losing bio-activity validated in advance, the concept of bioisosterism has emerged. Many in silico methods have been proposed for discovering bioisosteres, but they require expert knowledge for their applications or are restricted to known databases. Here, we introduce DeepBioisostere, a deep generative model to design suitable bioisosteric replacements. Our model allows an end-to-end chemical replacement by intelligently selecting fragments for removal and insertion along with their attachment orientation. Through various scenarios of multiple property control, we showcase the model's capability to modulate specific properties, addressing the challenge in molecular optimization. Our model's innovation lies in its capacity to design a bioisosteric replacement reflecting the compatibility with the surroundings of the modification site, facilitating the control of sophisticated properties like drug-likeness. DeepBioisostere can also provide previously unseen bioisosteric replacements, highlighting its capability for exploring diverse chemical modifications rather than just mining them from known databases. Lastly, we employed DeepBioisostere to improve the sensitivity of a known SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor to the E166V mutant that exhibits drug resistance to the inhibitor, demonstrating its potential application in lead optimization.
