abstract: "Liver toxicity poses a critical challenge in drug development due to
  the liver's pivotal role in drug metabolism and detoxification. Accurately
  predicting liver toxicity is crucial but is hindered by scattered information
  sources, a lack of curation standards, and the heterogeneity of data
  perspectives. To address these challenges, we developed the HepatoToxicity
  Portal (HTP), which integrates an expert-curated knowledgebase (HTP-KB) and a
  state-of-the-art machine learning model for toxicity prediction (HTP-Pred).
  The HTP-KB consolidates hepatotoxicity data from nine major databases,
  carefully reviewed by hepatotoxicity experts and categorized into three
  levels: in vitro, in vivo, and clinical, using the Medical Dictionary for
  Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. The knowledgebase includes
  information on 8,306 chemicals. This curated dataset was used to build a
  hepatotoxicity prediction module by fine-tuning a GNN-based foundation model,
  which was pre-trained with approximately 10 million chemicals in the PubChem
  database. Our model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an area
  under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.761, surpassing existing methods for
  hepatotoxicity prediction. The HTP is publicly accessible at
  https://kobic.re.kr/htp , offering both curated data and prediction services
  through an intuitive interface, thus effectively supporting drug development
  efforts."
