abstract: Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based drug–target interaction
  (DTI) models were highlighted for their high accuracy with affordable
  computational costs. Yet, the models' insufficient generalization remains a
  challenging problem in the practice of in silico drug discovery. We propose
  two key strategies to enhance generalization in the DTI model. The first is to
  predict the atom–atom pairwise interactions via physics-informed equations
  parameterized with neural networks and provides the total binding affinity of
  a protein–ligand complex as their sum. We further improved the model
  generalization by augmenting a broader range of binding poses and ligands to
  training data. We validated our model, PIGNet, in the comparative assessment
  of scoring functions (CASF) 2016, demonstrating the outperforming docking and
  screening powers than previous methods. Our physics-informing strategy also
  enables the interpretation of predicted affinities by visualizing the
  contribution of ligand substructures, providing insights for further ligand
  optimization.
