title: "Toward Generalizable Structure-based Deep Learning Models for
  Protein–ligand Interaction Prediction: Challenges and Strategies"
abstract: Accurate and rapid prediction of protein–ligand interactions (PLIs) is
  the fundamental challenge of drug discovery. Deep learning methods have been
  harnessed for this purpose, yet the insufficient generalizability of PLI
  prediction prevents their broader impact on practical applications. Here, we
  highlight the significance of PLI model generalizability by conceiving PLIs as
  a function defined on infinitely diverse protein–ligand pairs and binding
  poses. To delve into the generalization challenges within PLI predictions, we
  comprehensively explore the evaluation strategies to assess the
  generalizability fairly. Moreover, we categorize structure-based PLI models
  with leveraged strategies for learning generalizable features from
  structure-based PLI data. Finally, we conclude the review by emphasizing the
  need for accurate pose-predicting methods, which is a prerequisite for more
  accurate PLI predictions.
