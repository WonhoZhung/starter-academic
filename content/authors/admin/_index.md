I am a Ph.D. student at the Intelligent Chemistry Lab at KAIST (PI: Prof. Woo Youn Kim). My research focuses on developing deep learning methodologies to advance structure-based drug discovery. My work spans molecular design and protein-ligand interaction prediction while integrating physical and chemical principles into deep learning models to enable more generalizable and interpretable drug discovery. I am currently interested in (but not limited to) the following topics:
* AI for chemistry and biology
* Molecular generative modeling
* Structure-based drug design
