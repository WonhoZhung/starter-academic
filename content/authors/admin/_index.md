I am a chemistry Ph.D. student at the Intelligent Chemistry Lab at KAIST (PI: Prof. Wooyoun Kim), where I research the use of deep learning for solving chemical and biological problems.
Specifically, my goal is to find the hit compound by predicting the binding affinity, docking pose, etc. via drug-target complex modeling.
My other interests include various 3D representations such as graphs and point clouds, and related equivariant neural networks.

Besides research, I enjoy playing the violin. As a violinist in KAIST orchestra, I love to play classical music in ensembles.
