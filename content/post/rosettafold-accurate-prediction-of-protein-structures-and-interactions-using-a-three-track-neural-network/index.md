This post is based on a paper [Accurate prediction of protein structures and interactions using a three-track neural network](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/07/19/science.abj8754) by [David Baker](https://www.bakerlab.org/) at [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/).

> We obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the 1D sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated.
